If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(1), then the complexity of it is ?

a) constant
b) polynomial
c) exponential


a) constant

If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(1), it means that its running time remains constant regardless of the input size. 
Therefore, the complexity of such an algorithm is considered constant.
